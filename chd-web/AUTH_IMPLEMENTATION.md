# Frontend Auth Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

All auth UI features have been successfully implemented for the HeartSense application.

---

## 📋 Deliverables

### 1. **Core Components Created**

#### UI Components (`src/components/ui/`)
- ✅ `Button.tsx` - Reusable button with primary/secondary/ghost variants, loading states
- ✅ `Input.tsx` - Form input with label, error handling, helper text, accessibility
- ✅ `Toast.tsx` - Toast notification system with success/error/info types

#### Auth Pages (`src/pages/`)
- ✅ `login.tsx` - Email/password login with validation and redirect logic
- ✅ `signup.tsx` - Registration with email/password/name and client-side validation
- ✅ `my-data.tsx` - Protected page with auth guard and "Coming Soon" placeholder

#### Navigation
- ✅ `Nav.tsx` - Updated navbar with:
  - Auth-aware state (Login button vs. Profile dropdown)
  - "My Data" link with redirect to login if unauthenticated
  - Desktop & mobile responsive menus
  - User avatar with initials
  - Profile dropdown with Sign Out

#### Auth Client (`src/lib/`)
- ✅ `supabaseClient.ts` - Dual-mode auth client:
  - Real Supabase client when env vars configured
  - Mock auth provider fallback for local dev
  - `useAuth()` hook for component integration
  - Full auth state management

## 🎨 Design & UX

### Color Theme
- Primary brand: Red (#DC2626, #EF4444)
- Matches existing site theme (red-600, red-700)
- Consistent with Hero, CTA buttons, and branding

### UI Patterns
- ✅ Rounded corners: `rounded-2xl` for cards
- ✅ Shadows: `shadow-lg`, `shadow-xl` for depth
- ✅ Transitions: Smooth color and transform transitions
- ✅ Focus states: Ring utilities for keyboard navigation
- ✅ Responsive: Mobile-first design with breakpoints

### Accessibility
- ✅ ARIA labels and roles
- ✅ Keyboard navigation support
- ✅ Focus visible states
- ✅ Screen reader friendly
- ✅ Semantic HTML

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

### Mock Auth (Default - No Setup)
```
Sign Up → Creates user in localStorage → Auto sign in → Redirect to /my-data
Sign In → Validates format → Retrieves from localStorage → Redirect
Sign Out → Clears localStorage → Updates navbar → Redirect home
```

### Real Supabase Auth (Optional)
```
Set env vars → Auto-detected → Real Supabase calls → Full auth flow
```

### Roles and Storage (New)

- Roles supported: `patient` and `doctor`. Role is stored in `user_metadata.role` at signup.
- Secure Storage Bucket: `heartsense-data`
  - Each user’s files are stored under prefix `${user.id}/...`
  - Frontend uploads single prediction and batch results as CSVs automatically
  - Profile page lists, previews, and downloads user CSVs

Recommended Supabase SQL (run once):

```sql
-- Create storage bucket
insert into storage.buckets (id, name, public) values ('heartsense-data', 'heartsense-data', false)
on conflict (id) do nothing;

-- RLS policies to restrict access to own files only
-- List: allow listing only within own folder
create policy if not exists "Users can list their own files"
on storage.objects for select
to authenticated
using (bucket_id = 'heartsense-data' and (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text);

-- Upload: allow users to upload only to their own folder
create policy if not exists "Users can upload to their folder"
on storage.objects for insert
to authenticated
with check (
  bucket_id = 'heartsense-data' and
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Download: allow users to download their files
create policy if not exists "Users can download their files"
on storage.objects for select
to authenticated
using (bucket_id = 'heartsense-data' and (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text);
```

Notes:
- Doctors and patients both only see their own data by default. To allow doctors to view patient data, implement a mapping table with explicit grants and adjust policies accordingly.

## 📄 Pages & Routes

| Route | Description | Auth Required |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| `/` | Home page | No |
| `/predictor` | Risk assessment tool | No |
| `/login` | Sign in form | No |
| `/signup` | Registration form | No |
| `/my-data` | User data placeholder | Yes (redirects if not auth) |
| `/about` | About page | No |
| `/privacy` | Privacy policy | No |

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### Local Development (No Auth Setup)
```bash
cd chd-web
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000 and use the mock auth:
- Sign up with any email format and password 8+ chars
- Data stored in browser localStorage
- Full UI flow works immediately

### Production with Supabase
```bash
# 1. Create .env.local from template
cp .env.example .env.local

# 2. Add your Supabase credentials
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxx.supabase.co
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJxxx...

# 3. Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria Verified

1. ✅ When not logged in, navbar shows "Sign In" button
2. ✅ Clicking "My Data" when unauthenticated → redirects to `/login?next=/my-data`
3. ✅ Login page validates email/password on client
4. ✅ Signup page validates all fields with proper error messages
5. ✅ After sign in, navbar shows profile avatar and dropdown
6. ✅ Profile dropdown contains: email, My Data link, Sign Out
7. ✅ Clicking Sign Out clears auth state and updates navbar
8. ✅ `/my-data` shows "Coming Soon" placeholder when authenticated
9. ✅ `/my-data` redirects to login when not authenticated
10. ✅ All styling matches existing site theme (red primary, consistent spacing)
11. ✅ No backend code created or modified
12. ✅ Forms have accessibility attributes and keyboard navigation

## 📝 UX Copy Used

### Login Page
- Headline: "Welcome back"
- Subtitle: "Sign in to access your saved analyses"
- Helper: "Password must be at least 6 characters"
- Link: "Forgot password?" (UI only, shows toast)

### Signup Page
- Headline: "Create an account"

- Helper: "Must be 8+ characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number"

### My Data Page
- Auth Required: "Coming soon — your saved results will appear here."
- Features Preview: Save analyses, export PDF/CSV, view trends, share reports

## 🎯 Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

The following are planned but not implemented (placeholders shown):
- [ ] Real data persistence for saved analyses
- [ ] Export to PDF/CSV functionality
- [ ] Trend visualization
- [ ] Email verification flow
- [ ] Password reset functionality
- [ ] User profile editing

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Mock Auth:**
   - Data stored in localStorage only
   - No server-side validation
   - Not suitable for production use

2. **My Data Page:**
   - Placeholder content only
   - No real data storage/retrieval

3. **Password Reset:**
   - UI link present but shows "Coming soon" toast
   - Real flow requires backend implementation
